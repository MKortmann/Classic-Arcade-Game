### Contributions

The game was done exclusively by me. Using the start code provided by Udacity (https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game), I was able to fix it and to program the complety functionality of the game. The most work was done on the file index.html, app.js and style.css. It was done also some small changes at the file engine.js.

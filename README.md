## Basic Functionality

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water (upper corner), without colliding into any one of the enemies.

 - The player start at bottom and is able ton move left, right, up and down
 - The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board
 - Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square
 - Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won

### Contributions

The game was done exclusively by me. Using the start code provided by Udacity (https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game), I was able to fix it and to program the complety functionality of the game. The most work were on the file index.html and app.js!
